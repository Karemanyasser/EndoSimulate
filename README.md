# EndoSimulate, Graduation project of 4th-year biomedical Engineer students- Cairo University

Nowadays immersive technologies have become an integrated part of various sectors including 
entertainment, education, healthcare, and more. This technology is known as XR technology or Extended 
Reality. We address the existing gap in practical experience for medical students in the field of 
endoscopy. The problem at hand revolves around the steep learning curve associated with gaining 
proficiency in endoscopy, a crucial medical procedure for diagnosis and treatment. This project aims to 
bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills in endoscopy for medical students by 
developing an immersive environment to train novices on three different kinds of endoscopes (Knee 
Arthroscopy, Upper Endoscope, and Hysteroscopy).
