# EndoSimulate - VR Training for Endoscopic Procedures
Graduation project of 4th-year biomedical Engineer students- Cairo University

# Overview
In this project, we address the existing gap in practical experience for medical students in the field of 
endoscopy. The problem at hand revolves around the steep learning curve associated with gaining 
proficiency in endoscopy, a crucial medical procedure for diagnosis and treatment. This project aims to 
bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills in endoscopy for medical students by 
developing an immersive environment to train novices on endoscopic procedures through three 
modalities(Knee Arthroscopy, Upper Endoscope, and Hysteroscopy). [Our Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UJsRSS-PwjYNWfCId2RserrAGtM3VGm/view?usp=sharing)
## Importance of the Project
1. Safe & Controlled Environment: Trainees can practice procedures without concerns about patient safety.
2. Effective Practice: The VR simulation allows students to practice on various cases as many times as needed, from common procedures to rare and complex cases.
3. Objective Assessment: After each session, the system evaluates performance based on metrics like time taken, accuracy, and mistakes made. Trainees receive instant feedback for continuous improvement.

## Technologies Used
1. Unity: Our main platform for building the virtual environment, integrating HTC Vive Pro 2 for real-time user interaction.
2. Blender: Used for creating 3D assets, models, and animations.
3. HTC Vive Pro 2: Based on a decision matrix, the HTC Vive Pro 2 was selected for its high resolution, wide field of view, and accurate tracking, which is essential for realistic simulation in medical procedures.

## Features
1. Progress Tracking Website: Trainees can log in to track their progress and view detailed reports of their performance.
2. Three Training Tracks: The simulation offers different endoscopy tracks, allowing users to choose the type of endoscopy they wish to practice (e.g., Gastroscopy, Colonoscopy).
3. Multiple Difficulty Levels: Each track has various levels of difficulty, simulating cases from basic to advanced.
4. Visual & Auditory Feedback: The system provides instructional guidance through visual prompts and auditory cues during the procedures.

# Getting Started

## Installation
Unity [Download](https://unity.com/download)
## clone Endosimulate Repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Naira06/EndoSimulate.git
   ```
   Now, you will need to open Unity Hub and simply create a new Unity project by adding our project. Then, simply open Unity by clicking on the project you just added. Please note that we have tested the environment on Unity Version 2022.3.20f1.
